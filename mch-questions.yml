      Most likely, **your login is being throttled**. This can happen if you have too many failed login
      attempts. Wait **one** hour, [reset your password](https://account.mojang.com/password), then try logging
      into Minecraft.

      If that doesn't work, comeback here and select "No" when you answer this question.

      If you are only able to play demo mode after purchasing the game, the most likely cause is that **you have logged
      into the wrong Mojang account**. Check your email address for any misspellings, and try again.

      Other causes include:

        1. **Forgetting to set a profile name** ([you can do so here](https://account.mojang.com/me))
        2. **Forgetting to migrate your old Minecraft.net account**
       ([click here for help with migration](https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/438361))

      For more information on how to fix this problem, please see this
      [Mojang Support article](https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/1218766) for information on how to
      fix your account.

      We do not offer support for modded clients or servers. For help with
      mods, contact the mod's author on the mod's thread (usually on Minecraft Forums).
      Also, try the [Modded Client Support](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/modded-client-support) section.

      If you would like help with removing all mods, see [this guide](http://hopper.minecraft.net/help/guides/reinstalling-minecraft/)
      for more information. You'll need to remove all mods before requesting
      support.

      Feel free to come back if the issue persists after uninstalling the mods.
