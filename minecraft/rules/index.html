<h2 class="page-subheading">1. General Rules:</h2>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li>You must be logged in through NickServ to speak on this channel. Use the command "/msg NickServ help identify" for help logging in and "/msg NickServ help register" for information regarding registration.</li>
        <li>Not reading the rules is no excuse for not following them. Same goes for the topic.</li>
        <li>All applicable rules and laws apply. The EsperNet rules can be found in the EsperNet Charter.</li>
        <li>This is a strictly Safe For Work (SFW) channel. All chat and all linked or otherwise posted content is expected to be PG13. Do not post material unsuitable for children.</li>
        <li>Do not post any malicious material. This includes exploits for IRC, Minecraft, or computers in general.</li>
        <li>Do not distribute modified client or server software in this channel. Do not download any minecraft software from this channel either, for your safety.</li>
        <li>Unauthorized talking bots or scripts are not permitted. Bots are permitted as long as they do not send any unsolicited messages.</li>
        <li>Don't use auto-rejoin, it irritates the management.</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="page-subheading">2. Rules Regarding Other Users:</h2>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li>Do not harass other users. This includes, but is not limited to, sending unwanted messages or spamming/flooding.</li>
        <li>Be polite to the users around you. It takes two or more people to have an argument, and all are at fault.</li>
        <li>If you are experiencing issues with a specific user, it is recommended that you ignore them with the ignore command. Use "/help ignore" for more information. (note that this is a client feature and may not be available on all clients)</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="page-subheading">3.Rules Regarding Channel Operators:</h2>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li>Operate the channel fairly and appropriately.
        <li>Do not ignore users who try to appeal their bans. Among other things, this encourages evasion.</li>
        <li>Kick and ban reasons are to be clear and concise, so that they may be easily accessible in the channel logs.</li>
        <li>It is the job of the operators to enforce the channel rules.</li>
        <li>Operators should be able to justify their decision regarding removal of a user, and their decision may be overturned by a consensus from the other operators.</li>
        <li>Operators are to follow the rules of general users, their position does not make them exempt.</li>
        <li>Operators should not remove bans placed by other operators except under extenuating circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="page-subheading">4. Rules Regarding Consequences:</h2>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li>Being kicked from the channel serves as a warning. If you are kicked, keep in mind that further disquiet will likely result in a ban.</li>
        <li>If you are banned, do not evade it. Period. You will be banned for longer, and possibly banned from the network.</li>
        <li>In general, if you are banned, you have the right to know why.</li>
        <li>For ban appeals, you can appeal to any op in the channel. However, under most circumstances, it is up to that person whether your ban is justified.</li>
        <li>The ban duration shall fit the offense.</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="page-subheading">5. Important Notes:</h2>
    <ul class="indent">
        <li>For issues with Minecraft, see #minecrafthelp. For issues with the Minecraft forum, use #minecraftforums. For modding discussion, see #risucraft. For help with Spigot, see #spigot.</li>
        <li>This is a Minecraft channel. Discussion related to Minecraft is not required, but should take priority over unrelated chatter.</li>
        <li>These rules serve as guidelines. Management has discretion to do as it sees fit.</li>
    </ul>
